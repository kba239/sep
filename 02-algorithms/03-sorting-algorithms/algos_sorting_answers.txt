4. Benchmark results:

            user     system      total        real
Heap Sort:   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000047)
Quick Sort:   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000069)
Bucket Sort:   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000156)

5. Heap sort was the fastest, followed by quick sort, and then bucket sort.
Heap and quick sorts were significantly faster than bucket sort in this case.
I believe the difference in performance between quick and heap sorts and the bucket sort would increase as the number of items increased.
The performance of the heap sort would probably decrease as the number of items increased, making the quick sort the best choice for larger sets of items.
The performance of the bucket sort depends on the number of buckets used.
For example, if the items were only sorted into two buckets, the bucket sort would perform similarly to a quick sort.
