1. An algorithm that has O(1) efficiency is like a plane and an algorithm that has O(2^n) efficiency is like a bike.
2. The best case scenario for binary search is 𝛀(1), which would mean that the item is found on the first try.
3. The worst case scenario for binary search is O(log n), which would mean that the item is not found and all items are searched.
4. The bounded-case scenario for binary search is 𝛳(log n), which would mean that the item is found between O(1) and O(log n).
6. The limit of the function as n approaches infinity is infinity.
7. The Big-O of an algorithm that has the data points above is O(2^n).
10. The Big-O of binary search is O(log n).
11. The Big-Omega of binary search is 𝛀(1).
12. The Big-Theta of binary search is 𝛳(log n).
