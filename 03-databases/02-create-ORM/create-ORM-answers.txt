1. A RubyGem is an application or library that is useful for supplementing another application. By creating BlocRecord as a RubyGem, we can easily integrate it with AddressBloc.
2. A method that uses lazy loading only executes when necessary and provides requested data, while a method that uses eager loading executes when created and also provides related data.
3. CREATE TABLE creates a table with specified headers, rows, and columns; INSERT INTO adds the data into the rows and columns of the table.
4. Extend provides access to class methods from a module, while include provides access to instance methods.
5. The save methods in persistence.rb need to be instance methods (instead of class methods) because the databases is being saved as an instance of BlocRecord.
6.  UPDATE Character
    SET character_name = "Jar-Jar Binks", star_rating = 1
    WHERE id = #{self.id};
7. We will need to use BlocRecord's create method.
